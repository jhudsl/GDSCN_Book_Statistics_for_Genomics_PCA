# Overview

Being able to understand and apply dimensional reduction techniques is vital in order to work with the large, complex datasets that are standard in bioinformatic analysis. This lesson offers an in-depth exploration of common dimensional reduction techniques as implemented in R. It can be used on its own or as a supplement with other AnVIL lessons. During this lesson, students will work hands-on with publicly available data in the RStudio environment on [AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/) cloud computing resource to apply methods of dimensional reduction, visualize the results, and choose the appropriate number of dimensions for use in downstream analyses.
